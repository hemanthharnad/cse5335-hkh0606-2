1) What is your external data source used to populate your Heroku data sources?
I have used http://www.filltext.com/ to generate the json file that contains 150 elements.

2) What are the Heroku toolbelt commands to execute the scripts?


3) What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
I found it easy to load data into the addons created on heroku.

4)What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Retrieving data from redis was hard as it stored data in key/value pairs.
